/**
 * As a matter of fact, catching IOException seems to be a major issue on Solaris
 * since it might actually be a java.io.InterruptedIOException that extends java.io.IOException
 * but must be handled like an InterruptedException, i.e. it should interrupt the current
 * thread.
 *
 * Catching java.lang.Exception or java.lang.Throwable has the same problem
 * since those could swallow either java.lang.InterruptedException
 * or java.io.InterruptedIOException, too.
 *
 * Use the method {@link #interruptIfNecessary(Throwable)} in those cases to make sure that
 * the current thread is interrupted properly. This method calls {@link java.lang.Thread#interrupt()}
 * on the current thread if either exception is contained in the cause hierarchy.
 *
 * The methods {@link #closeQuietly(InputStream)}, {@link #closeQuietly(OutputStream)},
 * {@link #closeQuietly(Reader)} and {@link #closeQuietly(Writer)} are replacements for the corresponding
 * methods in org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils. In addition, this class also includes a similar
 * {@link #closeQuietly(RandomAccessFile)} method for use with {@link RandomAccessFile}.
 *
 * This class is a direct result of http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=4385444
 * as well as the corresponding log4j bug report at https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=44157
 *
 * It was brought to my attention by the following post to the logback-user-mailinglist:
 * http://www.qos.ch/pipermail/logback-user/2010-July/001644.html
 * 
 * Thanks to Andreas Dejung for teaching me yet another piece of Java.
