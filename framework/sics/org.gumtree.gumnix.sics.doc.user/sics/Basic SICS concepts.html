<h2>Basic SICS concepts</h2>

<hr size="4" width="66%">
<h3>General structure</h3>

<p>
 SICS is a client server system. The application the user sees is
 usually some form of client. A client has two tasks: the first is  to
 collect user input and send it to the SICS server which then executes
the command. The clients second task is to listen to the the server
 messages and display them in a readable format. This aproach has two
 advantages: clients can reside on machines across the whole network
 thus enabling remote control from everywhere in the world. The second
 advantage is that new clients (such as graphical user interface
 clients) can be written in any feasible language without changes to
 the server.</p>


<h3>SICS Command  Syntax </h3>

<p> SICS is an object oriented system. This is reflected in the command
syntax. SICS objects can be devices such as motors, single counters,
histogram memories or other hardware variables such as wavelength or
Title and measurement procedures. Communication with these objects
happens by sending messages to the target object. This is very simply
done by typing something like: object message par1 par2 .. parn. For
example, if we have a motor called A1:</p>
<pre>         A1 list<br></pre>
 will print a parameter listing for the motor A1. In this example
no parameters were needed. There exist a number of one-word commands as
well. For compatability reasons some commands have a form which
resembles a function call such as:
<pre>           drive a1 26.54<br></pre>

 This will drive motor a1 to 26.54. All commands are 
ASCII-strings and usually in english. SICS is in general CASE INSENSITIVE.
However, this does not hold for parameters you have to specify. On a unix
system for instance file names are case sensitive and that had to be
preserved. Commands defined in the scripting language are lower case by
convention.  
<p></p>

<p>
Most SICS objects also hold the parameters  required for their proper
operation. The general syntax for handling such parameters is:
</p>
<pre>objectname parametername<br></pre>

prints the current value of the parameter 
<pre>objectname parametername newvalue<br></pre>

sets the parameter value to newvalue if you are properly authorized.
<p></p>

<h3>SICS variables</h3>

<p> Most of the parameters SICS uses are hidden in the objects to which
they belong. But some are separate objects of their own right and are
accessible at top level. For instance things like Title or wavelength.
They share a common syntax for changing and requesting their values.
This is very simple: The command <i> objectname </i> will return the value, the command <i> objectname newvalue </i> will change the variable. But only if the authorisation codes match. </p>

<p>
</p>
<h3>Authorisation</h3>

<p> A client server system is potentially open to unauthorised hackers
who might mess up the instrument and your valuable measurements. A
known problem in instrument control is that less knowledgeable user
accidentally change instrument parameters which ought to be left fixed.
In order to solve these two problems SICS supports authorisation on a
very fine level. As a user you have to specify a username and password
in order to able to access SICS. Some clients already do this for you
automatically. SICS support four levels of access to an instrument:</p>
<ul>
  <li> <b> Spy </b> may look at everything, request any value, but may  not actually change anything. No damage potential here.
  </li>
  <li> <b> User </b> is privileged to perform a certain amount of operations necessary to run the instrument.
  </li>
  <li> <b> Manager </b> has the permission to mess with  almost everything.  A very dangerous person.
  </li>
  <li> <b> Internal </b> is not accessible to the outside world and
is used to circumvent protection for internal uses. However some
parameters are considered to be so critical that they cannot be changed
during the runtime of the SICS-server, not even by Managers.
  </li>
</ul>

 All this is stated here in order to explain the common error message:
 You are not authorised to do that and that or something along these
 lines.
