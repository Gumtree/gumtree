<p class="documentDescription">How to get onto the Instrument Control Computer and into the SICS software.</p>

    
        
    
        
            
<h2 class="Heading">Introduction</h2>
If you are looking here it is probably because you need to do some work on the command line.&nbsp; We have prepared a <a title="Linux Command Guide" href="http://gumtree:9080/nbicms/instruments/instrument-control-familiarisation/contents/resolveuid/16e7b725f6164ccfe258f0a9e19c632c" target="_self">brief guide</a>
to useful system commands because the instrument control software runs
on Linux computers with which many people may not be familiar.
<p><br>
There
is an instrument control system computer (ICS) for each instrument. The
ICS computer runs the SICS instrument control software which allows the
computer to control the instrument. The SICS software uses a set of
configuration files that define the controllable hardware of the
instrument.<br>
</p>
<p>Users of the instrument must have a valid ICS username and password with
which they can log into the ICS computer. This may not be the same as any other
username and password that a user may have.</p>
<p>Users
of the SICS instrument control software must have a valid SICS username
and password with which they can log into the SICS software. This may
not be the same as any other
username and password that a user may have, and will usually be
different. <br>
 </p>
<p><br>
</p>

<h2 class="Heading">Connecting to the ICS</h2>
<p>You may use the ICS at the console of the computer, in the instrument cabin.</p>
<p>You
may also connect to the ICS from the ANSTO network by using the ssh
(secure shell) protocol. The name of each ICS computer is derived from
the name of the instrument. The
ICS computer for the Echidna instrument&nbsp; is
"ics1-echidna.nbi.ansto.gov.au".</p>
<p>In either case, you will be prompted to log into the computer.<br>
 </p>
<br>
<h2 class="Heading">Logging into the ICS</h2>
<p>Once
you are connected to the ICS, you should be prompted for your username.
Log onto the ICS by entering your ICS username and password at the
prompts.</p>
<p>When you have successfully logged into the ICS, you will be in your "home" directory.<br>
</p>
<h2 class="Heading">Starting the SICS Software<br>
</h2>
<p>The
SICS software must be running on the instrument control computer. This
may be started by calling the "runsics start"&nbsp; command as shown below.<br>
</p>
<p>Note: the "echidna@ics1-echidna:~&gt;"&nbsp; is just the command line prompt.<br>
</p>
<pre>echidna@ics1-echidna:~&gt; runsics start<br><br>Starting SICS<br>29087<br>SUCCESS<br><br><br>Starting SICS Script Validator<br>29091<br>SUCCESS<br><br></pre>
<p>You can also call "runsics status" for check if sics is running and "runsics stop" to stop SICS and the script validator.<br>
</p>
<h2 class="Heading">Connecting to the SICS Software<br>
</h2>
<p>From
your home directory on the ICS computer, connect to SICS using the
"socat" tool. This will give command line history and editing.</p>
<pre>socat READLINE,history=echidna_history TCP4:localhost:server-echidna,crnl<br></pre>
<p>In this example, the "socat" tool connects your keyboard and screen to the SICS software.</p>
<p>
The READLINE method is used on the keyboard allowing command editing
and history recall. The command history is saved between sessions in
the file "echidna_history" in your current directory, which should be
your home directory.</p>
<p>The connection is established by TCP/IP to
the current computer ("localhost") on the port identified by the
service "server-echidna" which is congigured into the system. On other
instruments, replace the "echidna" with the name of the instrument.<br>
</p>
<h2 class="Heading">Logging into the SICS Software</h2>
<p>Once
you are connected to SICS, you must log into SICS as a SICS user. There
is no prompt for your username, only the generic "OK" prompt that SICS
issues when asking for input.</p>
<p>Just type in your SICS username and
password on the line and press the RETURN key. Your username and
password will echo on the screen and be visible to any other people
nearby.</p>
<p>If you are not successful, SICS will tell you. If you are successful, SICS will tell you that too.</p>
<pre>OK<br>list<br>ERROR: Bad login<br>myusername mypassword<br>Login OK</pre>
In
this example, the "OK" prompt was received after connecting to the SICS
software. The "list" command was issued without logging in and SICS
does not recognise it as a successful login. When a correct username
and password is entered, SICS announces that the login was successful.
SICS commands can now be entered.
