<h2>System Commands</h2>

<p>
<b> sics_exitus </b>. A single word commands which shuts the server down. Only managers may use this command.</p>

<p>
 <b> wait <i>time</i> </b> waits time seconds before the next command is executed. This does not stop other clients from issuing commands.</p>

<p>
 <b> resetserver </b> resets the server after an interrupt.</p>

<p>
 <b> dir </b> a command which lists objects available in the SICS
 system. Dir without any options prints a list of all objects. The
 list can be restricted with:
</p>
<dl>
  <dt>dir var
  </dt>
  <dd>prints all SICS primitive variables
  </dd>
  <dt>dir mot
  </dt>
  <dd>prints a list of all motors
  </dd>
  <dt>dir inter driv
  </dt>
  <dd> prints a list of all drivable objects. This is more then motors
and includes virtual motors such as environment devices and wavelength
as well.
  </dd>
  <dt>dir inter count
  </dt>
  <dd>Shows everything which can be counted upon.
  </dd>
  <dt>dir inter env
  </dt>
  <dd>Shows all currently configured environment devices.  
  </dd>
  <dt>dir match wildcard
  </dt>
  <dd>lists all objects which match the wildcard string given in
wildcard. 
  </dd>
</dl>

<p></p>

<p>
 <b> status </b> A single word command which makes SICS print its
current status. Possible return values can be: Eager to execute
commands, Scanning, Counting, Running, Halted. Note that if a command
is executing which takes some time to complete the server will return
an ERROR: Busy message when further commands are issued.
</p>

<p>
<b>status interest</b> initiates automatic printing of any status change in the
server. This command is primarily of interest for status display client
implementors.
</p>

<p>
<b>backup <i>[file]</i></b> saves the current values of SICS variables and selected
 motor and device parameters to the disk file specified as
 parameter. If no file parameter is given the data is written to the
 system default status backup file. 
 The format
 of the file is a list of SICS commands to set all these parameters
 again. The file is written on the instrument computer relative to the
 path of the SICS server. This is usually /home/INSTRUMENT/bin. 
</p>

<p>
<b>backup motsave</b> toggles a flag which controls saving of motor 
 positions. If this flag  is set, commands for driving motors to the
  current positions are included in the backup file. This is useful
  for instruments with slipping motors.
</p>

<p>
<b>restore <i>[file]</i></b> reads a file produced by the backup command described 
above and restores SICS to the state it was in when the status was saved with
 backup. If no file argument is given the system default file gets
 read. 
</p>

<p>
<b>killfile</b> decrements the data number used for SICS file writing
and thus consequently overwrites the last datafile. This is useful
when useless data files have been created during tests. As this is
critical command in normal user operations, this command requires
managers privilege. 
</p>

<p>
<b>sicsidle</b> prints the number of seconds since the last invocation of a counting
 or driving operation. Used in scripts.
