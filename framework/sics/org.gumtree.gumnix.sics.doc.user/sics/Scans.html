<p class="documentDescription">An introduction to running scans in SICS</p>

    
        
    
        
            
<h2 class="Heading">What is a SICS Scan</h2>
<p>A
SICS scan allows you to perform a sequence of measurements while
stepping one or more variables through a sequence of values. For
example, you could record the histogram memory from the detector while
you step a motor through a sequence of positions, such as stth from 74
to 70 degrees by one degree steps.<br>
</p>
<br>
<h2 class="Heading">Defining a scan command</h2>
<p>Scan
commands must be set up in the SICS configuration file. When defining a
scan command, the characteristics of the scan command, such as the
counter that is used to control the scan and some files that are used
by the scan, are defined.<br>
</p>
<p>Echidna has been set up with two scan commands:</p>
<ol start="1">
  <li>hmscan</li>
  <li>bmonscan</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="Subheading">hmscan</h3>
<p>Uses
the 128 tube area detector to collect data during scans.&nbsp; It is
configured to use a separate counter as a beam monitor to control the
scans.</p>
<h3 class="Subheading">bmonscan</h3>
<p>Uses a single counter to collect data during scans.&nbsp; This is the same counter that is used for the beam monitor by the <b>hmscan </b>command.</p>
<p>Both scan commands automatically save the data collected during a scan&nbsp; under the <b>/usr/local/sics/data/000</b> directory of the SICS host computer.&nbsp; The data includes the position of all the motors and the values of some variables.</p>
<p>You can define your own scan commands by adding a configuration to the SICS configuration file, see&nbsp;<a title="Running Scans" class="generated" href="http://gumtree:9080/nbicms/instruments/instrument-control-familiarisation/contents/resolveuid/cb7d7eccc0b36ddebb4f2ddf6ae21257" target="_self">Running Scans</a> for some notes on configuring scans. <br>
</p>
<h2 class="Heading">Preparing a scan command</h2>
<p>Before
you can run a scan you have to add one or more scan variables to the
scan command. A scan variable might be a motor or an environment
controller like a temperature controller. Each scan variable is added
with an initial value and a step size. When the scan is run, the each
of variables are driven to the initial value for the first step and
each variable is stepped by the step value for each subsequent setp.<br>
</p>
<pre>hmscan add stth 74 -1<br></pre>
<p>This
adds stth, the sample two-theta motor, to the scan command. This motor
rotates the position of the detector table around the sample table. The
position of the detector table will start at 74 degrees and be rotated
by minus one degree for each step of the scan.<br>
</p>
<h2 class="Heading">Running a scan</h2>
<p>NOTE: Currently you have to be logged on as a <b>manager</b> to run scans, this is a bug and will be fixed soon(ish).<br>
</p>
<p>When
the scan command has been prepared you can then run it. The run command
specifies the number of steps and the mode and preset value&nbsp;for the
associated counter.<br>
</p>
<p>The following scan command will collect
data from the area detector. It will stop at 5 positions with the
counter in timer mode and run the counter for 10 seconds at each point
while collecting data.<br>
</p>
<pre>hmscan run 5 timer 10<br></pre>
<p>This will produce the following output</p>

<p>Some other useful sub-commands for hmscan and bmonscan are</p>
<ul>
  <li>clear: This removes all the scan variables from a scan (before preparing for a new scan)<br>
  </li>
  <li>noscanvar: Shows the number of variables configured into a scan</li>
  <li>getvarpar <i>i</i>: Gives descriptive info about scanvariable <i>i</i>.</li>
</ul>
