<h2 class="Heading">Client Server Architecture</h2>
<p>Instrument
control is based on a client server architecture, each instrument has a
dedicated server, called SICS,&nbsp; which receives commands from client
applications and then executes them by issuing control sequences to the
hardware.&nbsp; SICS was originally developed at <span class="link-external"><a href="http://lns00.psi.ch/sics/design/sics.html" target="_self">PSI</a></span>
to control the SINQ spallation source instruments.&nbsp; Drivers and site
specific extensions have been developed at ANSTO to control and provide
status information for motors, ancillaries and detectors for our
instruments.</p>
