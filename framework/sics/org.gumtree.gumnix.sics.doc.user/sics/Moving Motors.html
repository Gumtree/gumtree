<p class="documentDescription">An introduction to moving motors on an instrument.</p>

    
        
    
        
            
<p>Moving
motors on an instrument is done through SICS software on the instrument
iontrol system computer. Each motor on the instrument has a name in
SICS that reflects the function of the motor. Motors are accessed in
SICS through commands using the name of the motor.</p>
<p>Typical motors on Echidna are:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>mtth
- monochromator two-theta. This is the angle of rotation of the sample
stage about the monochromator. The angle is from the beam line.</li>
  <li>som - sample omega. This is the angle of rotation, of the sample stage about the vertical axis.</li>
  <li>stth - sample two-theta. This is the ange of rotation of the detector table about the sample stage.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="Heading">What is the Current Position of a Motor</h2>
<p>To find out the current position of a motor, just enter the name of the motor and press RETURN.<br>
</p>
<pre>mtth<br>mtth = 90.000000<br></pre>
<h2 class="Heading">Moving a Motor<br>
</h2>
<p>To
move a motor you can use the SICS "run" command or "drive" command on
one or more motors. The "run " command returns before the move is
complete, the "drive" command returns after the move is complete. To
move the sample angle to 5 degrees and the detector angle to 10 degrees
you can do the following:</p>
<pre>run som 5<br>run stth 10<br></pre>
<p>Apart
from a few blank lines (not shown) there is no indication of when these
commands complete. The second run command can be entered before or
after the first one completes. the "run" command can control more than
one motor at a time:</p>
<pre>run som 5 stth 10<br></pre>
<p>Another way
of doing this, that waits until the movement has completed before
allowing more commands is to use the "drive" command as follows:</p>
<pre>drive som 5 stth 10<br>new som position      5.000<br>new stth position    10.000<br>Driving finished sucessfully<br></pre>
<p>If
after entering the "drive" command another command is entered before
the command completes, SICS responds with "ERROR: Busy". When the
command completes, SICS announces the new postions and the successful
completion of the command.</p>
