        * Our strategy here is based on the observation that plotting the range

        * or 0.02 to 4.  We scale the min and max by an order of ten such that when
        * converted to integers (by a process not quite like trucation) the difference
        * between those two integers is a number greater than or equal to 10 and less
        * than (but not equal to) 100.  In other words, there will be a difference of
        * exactly two digits, which is a sensible precision to see in variation between
        * axis labels.  For example, the ranges listed above would all yield the integer
        * pair 1 to 40 (because the difference between those integers has two digits).
        * Given a pair of integers, the function proceeds to calculate appropriate labels.
        * If we are using the suggested range, we just round the min down to the next nice
        * label and we round the max up to the next nice label (unless the max and min are
        * already on nice labels).
