OVERVIEW
========

Introduction
------------

=== What is Gumtree ===
Gumtree is a software for managing large scale scientific instruments. The
primary role for Gumtree includes:

* _Controls_ and _monitors_ an instrument system
* _Plans_ and _executes_ experiments on an instrument
* _Retrieves_ and _displays_ experiment data from the system
* _Reduces_ and _analyses_ live or archived experiment data

Gumtree comes with two types of variation. The desktop mode, known as the
_Gumtree Workbench_, provides interactive user interface for the instrument
system, and can be run on major operating systems including _Windows_, _Linux_
and _Mac OS X_. The server mode, known as the _Gumtree Web Server_, provides
the remote instrument status to browsers and mobile devices.

The core of Gumtree is an application framework, named as the
_Gumtree Framework_. The goal of this framework is to deliver an open source
platform for developers to build their high quality scientific applications,
without reinventing the wheel. Gumtree can be distributed freely and is licensed
under the http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html[Eclipse Public License version 1.0]
(EPL v1.0).

Gumtree Project Overview
------------------------

=== Project Structure ===
The _Gumtree Project_ is an open source project hosted on the _Codehaus_
website. This project is financially sponsored by the _Australian Nuclear
Science and Techology Organisation_ (ANSTO), for its use on a number of neutron
scattering instruments in the OPAL research reactor complex.

The Gumtree development team follows the agile development methodology:
_"release early, release often"_, where shippable quality software is delivered 
every couple of weeks for public testing and review.

Requirement Analysis
--------------------

=== High Level Requirements ===
The design of Gumtree should meet the following requirements:

* *Instrument control* - The top requirement for Gumtree is the ability to drive
an instrument via a delicated instrument control system.
* *Data Access* - Gumtree should provide a user friendly way to retrieve data
from various sources, for example, local file system, devices or data grid.
* *Data visualisation* - Gumtree should be able to visualise data either from
the live system or data files.
* *Data reduction support* - Gumtree should be capable of providing mathematical
package to process live data or archived data in a certain way.
* *Simple user interface* - The front end of the system, either in desktop,
mobile or web mode, needs to be simple.
* *Scripting support* - Scripting works as a two edged sword: enabling users to
perform non standard operations and add extra values to the system.  For
example,  users can script to automate instrument control, or instrument
scientists may introduce new reduction script while GumTree is running.
Scripts can be run locally or remotely on a middleware server.
* *Persistence and crash recovery* - Crash recovery is essential for users to
minimise their time spent on resetting their running experiment.
* *Remote access* - Remote access is a nice tool for users to monitor and fix
simple problem during the experiment. Gumtree does not intent to provide full
remote access for instrument control outside of the facility.
* *Configurable* - Each application can be configured by user defined setting or
from a central configuration server. Instrument scientists and supporting
staffs can update the entries from the configuration server to change the
behaviour of those applications. Users may also be able to upload their
configuration to the server to sync between different instance of Gumtree.
* *Access control* - The application may limit its feature based on the role of
a user who has signed to the system.
* *Connectivity with other online services* - Gumtree should leverage other
services available from the instrument system, and provide add-on value by
mashing up services.
* *Support for rapid development* - Gumtree should be designed by using modern
software engineering techniques, such that code is more maintainable and
reusable.

=== Domain Analysis ===
The essential entity of this model is experiment. In a typical experiment, a
user plans a sequence of instructions to control devices managed by control
systems.  An experiment may also require additional metadata from various
sources for auditing purpose.  Once an experiment is executed, those control
systems will create raw data for further reduction.  Experiment can be optimised
by using this reduced data to make intelligent decision for the next step of the
experiment.

.Domain Model

=== System Analysis ===
Gumtree adopts the client-server model for distributed instrument control. In a
typical instrument system, there are a number of physical devices controlled by
a central sequencer via some kind of control system software stack. Along with
a centralised server, there are also a number of facility servers like
database and access control which provide additional non-control system related
services. From the user frontend, there are different computation devices for
accessing servers available in an instrument system. Gumtree fills in the gap
between the users and the instrument system.

Architectural Design
--------------------

=== Architecture Overview ===

Gumtree is based on the component based architecture.

=== Layered Architecture ===

=== Technology Choice ===

[float]
==== Java ====
The Java platform has been selected as the base platform for Gumtree. Java is
composed by three major components:

* *Java Virtual Machine (JVM)* - the JVM is a software platform that allows same
code, known as bytecode, to be executed on different operating system.
* *Class Libraries* - there are large set of reusable libraries from Java and
other third party providers for standard programming tasks such as user
interface and networking. 
* *Language* - the Java language is a static typed object oriented language
which claims to be the world's most popular programming language. Along with
the Java programming language, other static or dynamic typed languages can
be used to generate bytecode for running on JVM.

The majority of code from Gumtree is written in Java, so that we can leverage
the robustness and predictability of the static typed system. A small portion of
Gumtree is written in scripting languages, mainly Jython, in order to take the
advantage of their dynamic behaviour when quick code modification is required. 

[[Eclipse]]
[float]
==== Eclipse ====
The Eclipse platform is an application framework that runs on top of JVM.
Gumtree is built entirely on the Eclipse platform because it offers dynamic
modular system support (OSGi), native look and feel graphical user interface
widgets (SWT), desktop window management (Eclipse Rich Client Platform), and
lots of other add-on services. With using the Eclipse platform, we can build
various type of applications which range from simple headless mode servers to
large scale desktop applications. 

Eclipse has been increasingly adopted by the scientific community for building
desktop applications. There is a list of examples:

* *OpenGDA* - http://www.opengda.org/
* *Control System Studio* - http://http://cs-studio.sourceforge.net/
* *Data Analysis Workbench* - http://www.dawb.org/
* *Passerelle* - http://code.google.com/a/eclipselabs.org/p/passerelle/
* *NASA Maestro* - http://www.eclipse.org/community/casestudies/NASAfinal.pdf
* *Bioclipse* - http://bioclipse.net/
* *OpenChrom* - http://www.openchrom.net/main/content/index.php

=== Application Architecture ===
Software architecture is what determines the maintainability of a project. A
software project will not success if it is difficult to maintain. Gumtree has
chosen the modular framework architectural approach to keep its code
maintainable. Using modular framework approach has the following advantages:

* Framework forces reuse of software components
* Modular programming encourages developers to code under the separation of concerns

All applications developed in the Gumtree project are based on a Java
application platform called the *Gumtree Application Framework*, or *Gumtree
Framework* in short. This framework provides all necessary runtime and
components for building general purposed scientific applications.

For Gumtree to be used on the Bragg Institutue's neutron beam instruments, there
is an layer of software called the *Bragg Gumtree Extensions*, or simply *Bragg
Extensions*, which contains additional support and customisation on the
framework.

The underlying kernel for Gumtree is a Java based dynamic modular system called
OSGi. OSGi is a lightweight application container which allows modular units,
known as bundles, to be installed or uninstalled during runtime. Gumtree
components and third party libraries are packaged into individual bundles, allow
developers to build their unique applications by mixing and matching different
modules.

=== Module Layout ===
The Gumtree project has separated into those major module groups:

* *Maven Build Parent* - A set of supporting projects for building Gumtree with
Maven build system  (https://github.com/Gumtree/gumtree/tree/master/parent)
* *Gumtree Framework* - The application framework for building Gumtree
applications (https://github.com/Gumtree/gumtree/tree/master/framework)
* *Bragg Extensions* - The frameworkwork extensions for building Bragg
Institute's neutron beam instrument applications
(https://github.com/Gumtree/gumtree/tree/master/bragg)
* *Project Infrastructure* - A set of supporting projects for Gumtree software
development and release engineering
(https://github.com/Gumtree/gumtree/tree/master/infrastructure)

=== Interoperability ===
The design goal of the Gumtree framework is all about reusability. In principle
all Gumtree components should be able to be reused on other Eclipse based
applications, such as those scientific applications mentioned in the
<<Eclipse,Eclipse>> section.

=== Programming Model ===
Gumtree has adopted few programming principles to improve its overall
code quaility.

[float]
==== Component Based Software Engineering ====
The component based approach encourage programmers to design their software by
the separation of concerns, which makes code more coherence and easier for
testing and reuse.

In modern Java software design, it is more favourable to code component in POJO
(Plain Old Java Object) style, and connects component with dependency injection
containers. Gumtree uses the Eclipse context from e4 as the dependency injection
container.

See also: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component-based_software_engineering

[float]
==== Service Oriented Architecture ====
The service oriented architecture allows components to be visible as services
across the system. This helps to improve the high level application
architectural design. In this architecture style, the consumers of the
components (services) only recongise the contracts (interface) provided by the
components, without knowing the actual implementation or instance of the
components. This approach can allow components to be swapped in and out to suit
different purposes, such as change of requirement or testing. 

Gumtree uses the OSGi service registery to manage the visibility of services.
Services can be registered into the runtime via the following methods:

* OSGi Declarative Services (recommended)
* Spring Dynamic Modules
* Manual registration using OSGi API

See also: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture

[float]
==== Resource Oriented Architecture ====
Any information that can be named is abstracted to _resource_, for examples:
document, image, database record, device, application state and functionality
(service). Each resource has unique identifier in form of URI. This
architectural style provides a simple and uniform way of resource discovery and 
manipulation. The Gumtree server uses this extensively for providing instrument
remote access. A noticable example of this architecture is REST
(REpresentational State Transfer), which is commonly used on World Wide Web.

See also: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource-oriented_architecture

[float]
==== Event Driven Programming ====
Listener design pattern is probably one of the most important mechanism for
modern applications. However, this subscribe and publish pattern can leads to a
highly coupled design. Instead, Gumtree uses the event bus design such that
the subscriber and publisher do not need to make any dependency on each other.

Event driven approach (or message passaging) can also improve application
performance when it comes to the multi threaded execution environment.

See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_programming

Programming Fundamentals
========================

Getting Started with Gumtree Development
----------------------------------------

=== Development Environment Setup ===
This chapter will introduce the quickest way to start Gumtree development. This
approach is suitable for developers who use Gumtree as a framework for building
their own applications. If you are interest in developing the Gumtree Framework
itself, please refer to the chapter on <<GumtreePlatformDevelopment,Gumtree
Platform Development>>.

[float]
==== Step 1 - Software Installation ====
Java Development Toolkit (JDK) and Eclipse IDE are the minimum software
requirement for developing Gumtree applications. 

.Java Development Toolkit
*******************************************************************************
* Gumtree development requires *Java SE version 6 or above*
* Download *JDK* from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html
* Install JDK into your local machine
*******************************************************************************

.Eclipse IDE
*******************************************************************************
* Gumtree development requires *Eclipse 4.2 or above*
* Download *Eclipse Classic* from http://www.eclipse.org/downloads
* Extract Eclipse into your local machine
*******************************************************************************

[float]
==== Step 2 - Create Development Directory ====
Although there is no special requirement for directory structure on Gumtree
development, it is preferable to follow some conventions 

.Create development folder
*******************************************************************************
* Create a new folder _<gumtree_directory>_ for Gumtree development
* For example: _D:\Development\Workspace\Gumtree_
* This folder will hold everything, including development tools, for your
Gumtree development.
*******************************************************************************

.Create IDE workspace folder
*******************************************************************************
* Create a sub folder _/source/plugins_ under _<gumtree_directory>_
* For example: _D:\Development\Workspace\Gumtree\source\plugins_
* The _/source_ folder holds some IDE generated contains
* The _/source/plugins_ is the actual Eclipse IDE workspace
*******************************************************************************

[float]
==== Step 3 - Setup Eclipse IDE ====
The Eclipse IDE is the primary development tool for developing Gumtree
applications. There are some configuration steps has to be done before coding.

.Additional JVM memory
*******************************************************************************
* 1GB of heap memory is required by the Eclipse IDE
* Configure your Eclipse IDE with more JVM memory by editing _eclipse.ini_
* Change the line in _eclipse.ini_ from _-Xmx512m_ to _-Xmx1024m_
*******************************************************************************

.Start IDE
*******************************************************************************
* Start Eclipse IDE and select _<gumtree_directory>/source/plugins_ as your
workspace
*******************************************************************************

.Configuring Java settings
*******************************************************************************
* Once the Eclipse IDE is launched, modify the Java setting from the preferences
dialog (usually under the Windows menu)
* Under the preferences dialog, select _Java->Compiler_, and ensure the _"Compiler
compliance level"_ is set to *1.6*
* Under the preferences dialog, select _Java->Installed JREs_ and *"Add..."* a
new JDK from your machine. Make sure the new JDK is selected after it is being
added.
* Using JDK instead of JRE gives additional development tools like javadoc
*******************************************************************************

[float]
==== Step 4 - Download Gumtree development libraries ====
Building application requires additional Java libraries. Those libraries 
are defined as *Target Platform* in the Eclipse IDE. The Gumtree target platform
is public available on _http://dist.codehaus.org/gumtree/sites/platform/1.8.x_.

.Add Gumtree target platform
*******************************************************************************
* Under the preferences dialog, select _Plug-in Development->Target Platform_
* Press _Add..._ to add a new target platform
* Select _"Nothing: Start with an empty target definition"_ and press _Next>_
* Enter *Gumtree* under the _Name:_ text box
* Press _Add..._ to include a target platform location
* Select _Software Site_ and press _Next>_
* Enter  *http://dist.codehaus.org/gumtree/sites/platform/1.8.x* under the
_Work with:_ text box and press _Enter_
* Select all three categories: *Gumtree Framework*, *Bragg Extensions*,
*Gumtree Infrastructure*, and press _Finish_. The IDE will take some time to
download all libraries.
* Press _Finish_ when download has been completed
* Finally select *Gumtree* from the _Target deinitions_ list and press _OK_
*******************************************************************************

If you have trouble configuring the target plaform, please read Eclipse help on:
http://help.eclipse.org/juno/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.pde.doc.user%2Fguide%2Ftools%2Fpreference_pages%2Ftarget_platform.htm

[float]
==== Step 5 - Verify development setup ====
Your development environment is almost ready when the target platform is loaded.
To verify the setup, we will need to launch an instance of Gumtre Workbench from
the IDE.

.Import product definitions
*******************************************************************************
* Switch to _Plug-in Development_ perspective
* Select the _Plug-ins_ view
* Right click on  the plug-in with name *org.gumtree.sdk.products*, and select
_Import As->Source Project_
* This will create a new project called *org.gumtree.sdk.products* in your
workspace
*******************************************************************************

.Launch Gumtree Workbench
*******************************************************************************
* From your workspace, navigate to the Gumtree Workbench product definition under
_org.gumtree.sdk.products->products->framework->workbench->Gumtree Workbench.product_
* Open the file *Gumtree Workbench.product*, and it will show the _Product
Configuration Editor_.
* Under the first tab _Overview_, click on the link *Launch an Eclipse application*
under _Testing_ section
* It will start an launch an instance of the Gumtree Workbench under your IDE
*******************************************************************************

GUMTREE FRAMEWORK
=================

Framework Overview
------------------

=== Gumtree Framework ===
The Gumtree Framework is an application framework for building Eclipse based
applications. It has special focus on delivering applications for the scientific
domain, like instrument control and data analysis. The minimium execution
requirement for the Gumtree Framework is Java 6 and Equinox OSGi runtime.

The framework provides the following components:

* *OSGi services* - the framework contains services like data access,
application persistence and scripting engine for the OSGi runtime
* *Common data model* - the data model provides an abstraction layer to deal with
multiple scientific data format within an application
* *Application containers* - the application containers enable Gumtree to be run
as web servers or as rich client desktop applications
* *Widget libraries* - a set of graphical user interface blocks for building
rich desktop or web applications  


=== Framework Structure ===
The Gumtree Framework is organised into a number of modules

Runtime Application Container
-----------------------------

=== OSGi Runtime ===
A Java application is effectively a single process running bytecode on a virtual
machine. The virtual machine process can only run bytecode which are specified
in the class path before the JVM is started. When working with large scale Java
application, class path management can be extremely difficult. Although bytecode
can be separated into jars, there is no way to control the loading order or
dependency between jar files. OSGi is born to resolve those problems. In the
OSGi module system, bytecodes are organised into modules of either jar files or
folders, with additional text entries in each _MANIFEST.MF_ file to specifies
the dependency between them. Each module is called *bundle* in OSGi terminology.
An OSGi enabled Java application is basically a bunch of bundles running on the
JVM.

The core of the OSGi system is a small kernel called the OSGi runtime. The
runtime itself is also a OSGi bundle, which provides bundle life cycle
management for dynamically loading and unloading bundles in a JVM process. On
top of the life cycle management, it also provides:

* *service registry management* - allows software components (plan java object) to
be registered and visible by all other components within a JVM process  
* *application management* - allows a single JVM process to host and execute
multiple applications

There are a number of OSGi implementations available. Two important one are
*Equinox OSGi* (used by Eclipse IDE) and *Apache Felix* (used by Java EE
application servers like GlassFish). Gumtree has chosen Equinox OSGi because it
is the fundamental part of the Eclipse application framework.
