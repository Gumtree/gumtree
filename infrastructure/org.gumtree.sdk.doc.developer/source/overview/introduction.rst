Introduction
************
Gumtree is a software system for performing experiments on large scale
instruments. Knowing the key features available in this platform can help you to
write and modify applications that are based on Gumtree.

Who Should Read This Document
=============================
The Book of Gumtree is for anyone who are looking to develop Gumtree
based software. It provides an overview of the technologies, as well as the
design and example usages. You should use this document to do the following:

* Learn about the Gumtree Application Framework.
* Learn about how to contribute new features to existing Gumtree applications.
* Get tips and guidelines on how to create new Gumtree applications.
* Evaluate Gumtree technologies as the alternative software stack to your instruments.

New developers should find the beginning chapters useful for getting familiar
with the Gumtree system. In depth discussion on the individual components and
advanced topics appear later in this book.
